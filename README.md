A vanilla javascript game

Project 1: Frogger General Assembly 

Frogger is a classic arcade action from the 80s, originaly developed by Konami. 
The object of the game is to direct frogs to the lilypads. You score points as you move closer 
and the obstacle speed/level is incremented every time you reach the lilypad. You will have to cross a busy road, navigate a river using logs and avoid the carnivore plants at the last hurdle. 

I created frogger for the end of module one project - We have only been looking at javascript for two weeks! We had a week 
to plan, develop and test the game.

## Brief

Requirements
* The game should be playable for one player.
* The obstacles should be auto generated.

Suggested enhancements
* Different difficulty levels.
* Auto generated boards.
* Two player mode on the same computer: players take turns the first to lose more lives across a whole game loses.
* High score board with `localStorage`

Challenges
* The main difficulty here is animating the obstacles and detecting collision. There will be a number of timers to manage across the whole game, which can be easily get out of hand.
